To create a detailed `README.md` file for uploading your CSV dataset to GitHub, I will need to inspect the contents of the file. Let me first load the data and then generate the README file based on it.

Based on the dataset, here's a detailed `README.md` file for your GitHub repository:

# Space Mission Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains information about 200 space missions, with various parameters related to the materials used, propulsion system characteristics, mission duration, environmental impact, and more. The dataset can be used for analysis in fields like space exploration, mission planning, and resource optimization.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains **12 columns** and **200 rows**, where each row represents a specific space mission. All the columns are numerical, and they provide key information about the mission's material composition, propulsion system, and overall mission metrics.

### Columns:

1. **Material_Density**: (float) The density of the material used in the spacecraft (kg/mÂ³).
2. **Material_Abundance**: (float) Availability or abundance of the material used (units unspecified).
3. **Composition_Ratio**: (float) Ratio of different materials composing the spacecraft.
4. **Thrust_kN**: (float) Thrust generated by the propulsion system (in kilonewtons).
5. **Fuel_Consumption**: (float) Fuel consumption rate during the mission (kg/s).
6. **Specific_Impulse**: (float) Efficiency of the propulsion system (seconds).
7. **Mission_Duration_days**: (float) Duration of the mission (in days).
8. **Resource_Allocation_Efficiency**: (float) Efficiency in utilizing allocated resources.
9. **Environmental_Impact**: (float) Impact of the mission on the environment (lower values indicate less impact).
10. **Structural_Integrity**: (float) Measure of the spacecraft's structural integrity (0-1 scale).
11. **Weight_kg**: (float) Total weight of the spacecraft (in kilograms).
12. **Modularity_Index**: (float) Measure of the modularity of the spacecraft's design (0-1 scale).

## Usage

You can use this dataset for a variety of tasks such as:

- **Mission Planning**: Analyze the relationship between material composition, fuel efficiency, and mission duration.
- **Spacecraft Design**: Investigate how structural integrity and weight affect mission performance.
- **Environmental Impact**: Examine the trade-offs between mission efficiency and environmental impact.

## File Format

The dataset is in CSV format, where each row corresponds to a space mission. 

- **File Name**: `space_mission_dataset.csv`
- **File Size**: 18.9 KB
